<h1 align=center><b>Neural Mental Triage</b></h1> 

## 💡 Inspiration

Mental illnesses are one of the most important public health issues, and so it deserves much attention and care. We realized with the rise in better technologies in Neural Networks and Machine Learning, we could use it to the best of our efforts and create tools to help folks to create better well-being.  After seeking out general research, and brainstorming we came up with the idea of our app, _Neural Mental Triage_: a questionnaire app built with NLP to help users with their mental health, and suggest tips and advice to improve their well-being.

## ✨ What it does

The application presents a simple UI, which allows the user to answer a questionnaire, designed carefully to understand the mental state of the user and present the user with tips and suggestions to help improve their mental health, with the help of Neural Networks.

## 🛠 How we built it

We initially started off with a brainstorming session, to discuss and identify the main mental health concerns of the present day. After recognizing the concerns, we looked into technologies in NLP that would allow us to address these concerns and suggest solutions to solve them. Then, we got into developing the app by each of us working on different technologies such as Flutter, FastAPi, and Tensorflow, while asking for continuous feedback. 

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into

- We initially had some trouble integrating the NLP model into our app with the help of an API, due to various parameters that had to be placed into each result that the model gives. 
- We had to ensure that the questions asked and the suggestions that the app gives are well designed, as the app will be used by folks of various mental backgrounds.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are really proud to have built an amazing NLP model with great accuracy in predicting the sentiments of its inputs _(accuracy: 86%)_. This allows us to handle the user's concerns in a much more careful way.
- Integrating the NLP Model with the Flutter App with the help of an API.
- To have built an application that could be used to allow users space to talk about their mental health, and make lives much easier and pleasant.

## 📖 What we learned

- Collaborating with folks with different skill sets.
- Understanding the importance of data in building great tools to help society.
- Integrating a Tensorflow-based Neural Network into a cross-platform application with the help of FastAPI.
- We also learned how it's essential to do good research to build an amazing application.

## 🙌 What's next for Neural Mental Triage

- Collaboration of the application with Medical Professionals to help navigate through the concerns in a continuous way.
- Integrate more tools for mental journaling, to allow users to track their progress.
